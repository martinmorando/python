# Notes, Code, and Experiments with Python 3

## Quick Overview
- Created in 1991
- It's free and open-source
- Curious fact: creator Guido van Rossum was the "[benevolent dictator for life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)" until 2018


## Motivations for Mastering Python
1. Wide range of applications and rich libraries
2. In particular, widely used in AI/ML
3. On top of (1) and (2), very simple syntax


## Topics
You can find base Python files (without external libraries) at the root (for easy access). The folders contain code related to external libraries (**Matplotlib**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Flask**) or specific topics (**Web Scraping**, **CSV Handling**).


## How to Install Libraries
For Linux systems:
1. Create a virtual environment
`python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate it
`source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install required libraries
`pip install pandas matplotlib BeautifulSoup`


## Running Python Code
1. Activate the virtual environment
2. Run script with: `python3 path/to/file.py`
