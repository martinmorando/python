## Motivations for Mastering Python
1. Wide range of applications and rich libraries
2. In particular, widely used in AI/ML
3. On top of (1) and (2), very simple syntax


## Topics
- Core
- Data Analysis
	- CSV Handling
	- Matplotlib
	- Pandas
- Web Scraping
	- BeautifulSoup
- Flask


## How to Install Libraries
For Linux systems:
1. Create a virtual environment
`python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate it
`source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install required libraries
`pip install pandas matplotlib BeautifulSoup`


## Run Python Code
1. Activate the virtual environment
2. Run script with: `python3 path/to/file.py`
